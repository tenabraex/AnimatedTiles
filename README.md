# BunnyViking's animated tiles'n'stuff

Animated tiles and other assets for VTTs

I have tested these as tiles in forge, and as whatever in roll20. Forge won't let you use wemb as an actor (yet?) only as a tile.

## Note on sizes

I output each file in 3 sizes which I currently base on the width of the file. The heigh of the file may vary (e.g. breath/linear effects aren't as tall)

Files have a note of their horizontal size, 1000, 500 or 250 (so that's 10squares, 5squares or 2.5squares by forge default or 100 pixel squares)

Currently i'm producing files based on forge scale, eventually i'll probably do roll20 friendly files as well (based on roll20s base 70 pixel size)
